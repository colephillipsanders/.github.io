# Welcome to my Web Mapping Portfolio!
Hi, I'm Cole Sanders.
This is a very basic first page for my website, which I will be building as part of the GIS course.
Here are a few things I might include later:
<!-- Add script to the <head> of your page to load the embeddable map component -->
<script type="module" src="https://js.arcgis.com/embeddable-components/4.32/arcgis-embeddable-components.esm.js"></script>
<!-- Add custom element to <body> of your page -->
 <arcgis-embedded-map style="height:600px;width:700px;" item-id="d9faf6659485436fa3062cfc598d0462" theme="light" heading-enabled portal-url="https://sdsugeo.maps.arcgis.com" ></arcgis-embedded-map>
* Information about my skills and experience
* A way to contact me
**Stay tuned for updates!**
